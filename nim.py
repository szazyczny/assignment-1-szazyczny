#(20 points) The game of Nim. 
# This is a well-known game with a number of variants. 
# The following variant has an interesting winning strategy. 
# Two players alternately take marbles from a pile. 
# In each move, a player chooses how many marbles to take. 
# The player must take at least one but at most half of the 
# marbles. Then the other player takes a turn. The player 
# who takes the last marble loses.

# Write a program in which the computer plays against a 
# human opponent. Generate a random integer between 10 and 
# 100 to denote the initial size of the pile. Generate a 
# random integer between 0 and 1 to decide whether the 
# computer or the human takes the frst turn. Generate a 
# random integer between 0 and 1 to decide whether the 
# computer plays smart or stupid. In stupid mode the computer
#  simply takes a random legal value (between 1 and n/2) from
#  the pile whenever it has a turn. In smart mode the computer
#  takes off enough marbles to make the size of the pile a power
#  of two minus 1â€”that is, 3, 7, 15, 31, or 63. That is always 
# a legal move, except when the size of the pile is currently 
# one less than a power of two. In that case, the computer makes
#  a random legal move.

# You will note that the computer cannot be beaten in smart 
# mode when it has the frst move, unless the pile size happens 
# to be 15, 31, or 63. Of course, a human player who has the 
# frst turn and knows the winning strategy can win against the 
# computer.



# You need to replace 'pass' with your code
